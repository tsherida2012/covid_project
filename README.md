Analyzing and Predicting COVID-19 Trends Using Our World in Data
"Tracking COVID-19 Trends and Predictive Modeling: A Global Comparative Analysis with Our World in Data"
The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges worldwide, emphasizing the need for accurate, accessible data to support decision-making and manage resources effectively. This project will leverage the World in Data COVID-19 dataset to analyze the progression of COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing rates, and other socio-economic indicators across countries and regions. By understanding these trends, we can derive insights into the effectiveness of interventions and identify factors contributing to better outcomes, which could be essential for future public health planning.
3. Objectives
The project will focus on three primary goals:
Trend Analysis: Visualize and interpret trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and testing rates across different countries and continents.
Comparative Analysis: Assess how factors like population density, median age, GDP per capita, and healthcare resources impact COVID-19 outcomes.
Predictive Modeling: Build a predictive model for recent cases using historical data and external factors, helping to expect potential outbreaks and inform timely interventions.
4. Data Overview
The project will utilize the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, which is updated daily and includes:
COVID-19 metrics: Confirmed cases, deaths, recent cases, testing rates, and smoothed averages.
Socio-economic and health indicators: Population density, median age, GDP per capita, healthcare resources (e.g., hospital beds per thousand), and more.
